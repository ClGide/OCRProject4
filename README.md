TinyDB for chess tournament management
Project 4 of my Python's OCR path

VERSION 1.0.0

The following code is designed to save and load data about a chess tournament in a TinyDB database. 
The program operates in two broad steps. 

Before the tournament starts, the program requests info about the tournament (venue, number of rounds, number of players...)
and about each player (name, age, sex...). 
Throughout the tournament, the program requests match results and pairs the players according to the swiss-system algorithm. 
It also allows the user to override a player's ranking or the tournament's description at any time. Finally, it enables 
the user to save or load data about the tournament in between rounds.
